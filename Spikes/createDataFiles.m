function createDataFiles(minfrequency,maxfrequency, N, neuronid, duration, jitterpercent, fileprefix, filenameroot)
%createDataFiles create a set of data files 
%   creates a set of data files suitable for the spiking neural
%   netsimulator. Each is at a constant spiking frequency, starting at
%   minfrequency, and going up to maxfrequency, inclusive (so N >= 2). 
%   duration is the length of the trains in seconds. The
%   jitter is a percentage of the inter-spike interval. Files are written
%   out to [fileprefix filenameroot '_' num2str(i) '.csv']
